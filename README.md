# Python-Mail-sender
This is a personal project, which allows you to send a page coded in html and css by email.



Step 1: Set up your Google Account
Enable Less Secure Access:

Go to your Google account page: Less secure application access.
Enable the “Allow less secure apps” option to allow apps like your Python script to send emails through your Google account.
Generate an Application Password:

If you have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for your Google account, you will need to generate an app password.
Go to your Google account page: App passwords.
Select "Mail" and "Device" (for example, "Windows Computer").
Click "Generate" and write down the password provided. Use this password in your Python script instead of your regular password.
Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries
Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the libraries with pip:

pip install smtplib
Step 3: Run the Python Script

To execute, enter “python send_email.py” in the terminal
First you must install python on your computer.
It is possible to add a sheet file containing the recipient email addresses
